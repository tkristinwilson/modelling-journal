# Modelling Journal
This repository contains modelling diagrams I've created and resources I've found helpful when learning to study and describe phenomena as social-ecological systems (SES).

Social-ecological systems research contains a lot of jargon. Some of it is inherited from complexity science. Other sources include ecology, natural resource management, economics, and political science. Numerous modelling frameworks exist to help focus analyses towards conceptual models, but these too can be confusing in terms of terminology, purpose, disciplinary approach, and implicit ontological commitments.

I've found it easier to visualise my own understanding first and then link this back to literature, theory, and data.

So, diagrams and tools for my past self, and with luck a future SES researcher.
